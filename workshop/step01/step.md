## Step 1

* Open a command-line tool of your choosing
* Browse to a local directory you'd like to work in
* Clone the CSharpWars GIT repository from github

```
git clone https://github.com/Djohnnie/CSharpWars-NDCLondon-2020.git
```

A directory will be created containing a *src* folder and a *frontend* and *backend* child folder.
* The *backend* folder contains a Visual Studio with containing multiple projects for both the ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi backend and the .NET Core 3.1 middleware worker service.
* The *frontend* folder contains the Unity frontend project.
